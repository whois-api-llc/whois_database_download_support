MySQL ASCII dump loader scripts
(BASH version)

(Note: there  is a  separate file  named README_Python.txt  for Python
scripts. If you do not plan to  work with huge domains such as .com or
you are using a Windows system, we recommend to first check the Python
scripts which contain a simple GUI and they are easier to use than the
bash shell scripts.)

The scripts are provided for our subscribers to load ASCII mysql dumps
obtained from our  quarterly feeds into MySQL RDBMS to  set up a WHOIS
database.  The scripts can be used also as an example to create custom
loader scripts.


Script availability:

whoisxmlapi_mysql_loaders

In addition, WhoisXML API subscribers can access the scripts from the
following URLs:

1. List of files:
----------------

README			  : this file
load_mysql_utils.sh	  : utility functions used in all scripts
			    	This should be there in the same
				directory as the scripts themselves
load_mysql_data_per_tables.sh: script to load schema first, then the data
			       from separate files
load_mysql_data_all.sh	:   script to load single-file backups

legacy			: a directory containing legacy versions of
			  these scripts which were in use before July 2017.
README_Python.txt       : Documentation of the Python scripts for the same task
load_mysq_data.py       : Python (series 2) script for the same task.
			  Documented separately in the file README_Python.txt

2. Obtaining data
-----------------

Sample data can be obtained from

http://domainwhoisdatabase.com/whois_database/sample/gtlds/v20/mysqldump_sample

(replace v20 by the actual version)

Production data can be obtained from

http://domainwhoisdatabase.com/whois_database/v20/database_dump/mysqldump/

(replace v20 by the actual version)

Single-file backups of production data can be also downloaded with our downloader scripts. Example:

./whoisdownload.sh --verbose --user my_username --password my_password  --db-version v20 --data-feeds whois_database --tld "aaa" --file-format sql --output-dir=testdir

We refer to the documentation of the downloader scripts for further details.

3. Software environment
-----------------------

The present version was tested with

mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.18

and

GNU bash, 4.3.48(1)-release

on a machine running Ubuntu Linux 16.4.02 LTS.

The scripts are standard ones which have to work with earlier versions
of bash  also on  other systems  (Linux, Mac OS  X, and  Windows).  It
should be compatible with other version of MySQL, too.

If you run into an incompatibility, please contact our support.

4. Loading schema and table data from separate files
----------------------------------------------------

Note: in the tasks described here and in Section 2.4 the syntax of the
used scripts is the same if you use the --tld option.

In the following example we plan to create our MySQL table for the tld
"aaa" loading the schema first, then the data.

This approach  is recommended for large  tlds such as "com".   In such
cases we also recommend to  use the --show-progress option which draws
a  progress bar  showing the  status of  loading of  each file  and an
estimated time  when it will be  ready. Note that e.g.  loading of the
data of the "com" domain will take several days, so it is important to
follow what is going on.

As an input we need the files

whoiscrawler_$version_$tld_mysql_schema.sql.gz

(e.g. whoiscrawler_v20_aaa_mysql_schema.sql.gz) and the "tables"
subdirectory in the same directory as this file.

The script to be used is load_mysql_data_per_tables.sh 

run  the script  with  the --help  option to  see  the parameters  and
examples to load  your data (the examples in the  help message scripts
are for loading the data of the "aaa" domain).

Note: the  script has three  options which can be  used to do  the job
partially, or the whole in multiple steps:

--no-create-db  skips the step of creating a new database.
		In this case the script assumes that the MySQL database
		to be used already exists.
--data-only	skips the loading of the schema,
		only loads data into the database.
		The database is assumed to exist in this case, too.
--schema-only   Loads the schema only (and creates the database without
		--no-create-db). The data are not loaded.


5. Loading single-file backups
------------------------------

Note: in the tasks described here and in Section 2.3 the syntax of the
used scripts is the same if you use the --tld option.

In the following example we plan to create our MySQL table for the tld
"aaa" loading its single-file backup

As an input we need the file

whoiscrawler_$version_$tld_mysql.sql.gz

E.g. whoiscrawler_v20_aaa_mysql.sql.gz .

The script to be used is load_mysql_data_all.sh 

run  the script  with  the --help  option to  see  the parameters  and
examples to load  your data (the examples in the  help message scripts
are for loading the data of the "aaa" domain).

6 Loading data for multiple tlds
--------------------------------

Assume you  have downloaded data for  the following tlds from  the v20
quarterly release:

asia,us,biz,mobi,info,org,net,com

and you have placed the data into a subdirectories

database_dump/mysqldump/$tld

of the directory where the scripts reside.

Assume you want to load them into databases named "production_db_$tld"
with your mysql user "whoisuser" who has the password "whoispassword".

To load  them all  so that you  load the schema  first then  data from
tables, the following command-line will do the job in bash:

	for tld in asia us biz mobi info org net com; do ./load_mysql_data_per_tables.sh --mysql-database=production_db_$tld --mysql-user=whoisuser --mysql-password=whoispassword --schema-files-dir=database_dump/mysqldump --tld=$tld --db-version=v20;done

Alternatively, you may load the data from single files:

        for tld in asia us biz mobi info org net com; do ./load_mysql_data_all.sh --mysql-database=production_db_$tld --mysql-user=whoisuser --mysql-password=whoispassword --dump-files-dir=database_dump/mysqldump --tld=$tld --db-version=v20;done

(Note that we have changed the name of the script only.)

The  above examples  can  be  used as  a  template  to manage  various
situations in bash.
